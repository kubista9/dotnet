This code implements a .NET Core API that can be used to retrieve data from external services.
The API uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication.

Classes

AzureAdOptions: This class stores the configuration options for the Azure AD integration, such as the client ID, client secret, tenant ID, and scope.
TokenController: This class contains the API endpoints for retrieving tokens and data from external services.
GetTokenFromAzureAd: This method retrieves a token from Azure AD using the client credentials flow.
GetTokenFromCache: This method retrieves a token from the in-memory cache.
GetDataFromUrl: This method retrieves data from an external URL using an HTTP GET request.
Token: This class represents an access token returned by Azure AD.
PollyPolicies: This class contains a retry policy for HTTP requests that result in a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.
Auth0Service: This class encapsulates the logic for interacting with Azure AD to retrieve tokens.
ExternalService: This generic class provides methods for making HTTP requests to external services.
TokenRetrievalHandler: This HTTP message handler adds an authorization header to outgoing requests if a token is available in the cache.
TokenService: This class manages the in-memory cache for access tokens.
Swagger Integration

The API includes Swagger integration for generating API documentation. You can access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:<port>/swagger/ui

CORS Configuration

The API is configured to allow CORS requests from any origin. This should be changed to a more restrictive policy in a production environment.

Readme

Azure AD API
This is a .NET Core API that demonstrates how to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication and caching to retrieve data from external services.

Prerequisites

.NET Core SDK
Azure Active Directory application
Configuration

Configure the Azure AD application settings in appsettings.json:
JSON
"AzureAd": {
"ClientId": "your-client-id",
"ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
"TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
"Scope": "your-scope"
}
Use code with caution.

Install the required NuGet packages:
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Controllers.Abstractions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
dotnet add package Polly
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory
Running the API

Build and run the API:
dotnet run
Access the API endpoints:
GET http://localhost:<port>/tokenFromAzure: Retrieves a token from Azure AD.
GET http://localhost:<port>/tokenFromCache: Retrieves a token from the cache.
GET http://localhost:<port>/data/{url}: Retrieves data from an external URL.
